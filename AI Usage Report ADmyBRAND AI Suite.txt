AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND AI Suite Project
This report provides a summary of how AI development tools were leveraged to build the ADmyBRAND AI Suite landing page.

1. AI Tools Used
Primary Tools:

GitHub Copilot: Used for real-time code completion, generating boilerplate, and suggesting logic within component files.

ChatGPT (or other LLM): Used for high-level planning, architectural suggestions, debugging complex issues, and generating initial component structures.

v0.dev / Midjourney (Optional): Mention if used for UI component generation or visual design inspiration.

Key Use Cases:

Component Scaffolding: Generated initial boilerplate for React components, including state, props, and basic JSX structure.

Styling with Tailwind CSS: Suggested class combinations for creating responsive layouts and implementing the custom design system.

Logic & Functionality: Assisted in writing logic for features like the FAQ accordion's state management and the testimonials carousel's auto-play functionality.

Content Generation: Provided placeholder text and content ideas for sections like the features and FAQ descriptions.

Debugging: Helped identify and resolve issues by pasting code snippets and asking for analysis.

2. Sample Prompts
Here are a few examples of prompts used during development:

For a new component:

"Create a responsive React functional component for a hero section using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It should have a main heading, a subheading paragraph, two call-to-action buttons ('Start Free Trial' and 'Watch Demo'), and a placeholder for a hero image on the right. The text should be on the left."

For styling/animation:

"How can I create a smooth 'fade-in-on-scroll' animation for sections in a React application using only CSS and Tailwind CSS classes? Provide the necessary CSS keyframes and utility classes."

For a specific function:

"Write a React hook in TypeScript called useScroll that returns true if the user has scrolled more than 10 pixels down from the top of the page, and false otherwise. This will be used to change the navbar style."

3. AI vs. Manual Work Split
AI-Generated (Approx. 40%):

Initial boilerplate for most components.

Utility functions (like cn in utils.ts).

First drafts of repetitive content and JSX structures.

Basic Tailwind CSS class strings for layout.

Manual Coding & Customization (Approx. 60%):

Refining UI/UX: Manually adjusted all AI-generated styles to match the specific design philosophy, including colors, spacing, shadows, and fonts from the custom theme in index.css.

Component Architecture: Integrated all individual components into a cohesive application structure (App.tsx, pages/Index.tsx).

State Management & Props: Handled the flow of props and state between parent and child components to ensure proper functionality.

Custom Logic: Wrote and refined the specific logic for the Navbar scroll behavior, Carousel navigation, and FAQAccordion toggle functionality.

Final Polish: All code was reviewed, refactored, and tested manually to ensure it was production-ready, performant, and bug-free.
