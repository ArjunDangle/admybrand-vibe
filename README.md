## Design & UI/UX Philosophy

The design of this landing page was heavily weighted in the evaluation, and the following principles were applied to create a premium user experience:

* **Modern Aesthetics**: The UI incorporates modern design trends, including a clean layout, soft shadows for depth, and a refined color palette to convey professionalism and trust.
* **Visual Hierarchy**: A clear and intuitive visual hierarchy guides the user's attention through the page, with distinct styles for headings, body text, and interactive elements.
* **Smooth Animations & Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations are used throughout the page to enhance the user experience. This includes fade-in-on-scroll effects, hover states on buttons and cards, and smooth transitions for the accordion and carousel.
* **Component-Driven Design**: The entire UI is built on a robust system of reusable components (Buttons, Cards, Modals, etc.), ensuring consistency and maintainability. This is powered by **shadcn/ui** and custom-styled components.
* **Typography**: The font `Manrope` was chosen for its modern and highly readable characteristics, with a consistent type scale applied across the site.
